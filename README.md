# Predicting Recycling Diversion

In New York City, Recycling Diversion rate and Capture Rate Capture are collected for each zone and district. This ratio measures how much of the targeted materials are being recycled, which is a measure of how successfully such materials are recycled. 

In order to understand what the participation rate or rate at which a district recycles is, we can explore the data for recycling collection. This gives opportunities for targeting education for specific zones and specific types of recycling. We can also use this dataset to predict recycling behavior.
